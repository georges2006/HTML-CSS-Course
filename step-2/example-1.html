    <p>
    Another text without &lt;br&gt;
    You can notice that the text don't go to a newline
    Because of non existant br
    </p>
    <p>We can create multiple &lt;p&gt; to go to a newline</p>
    <p class="one">This &lt;p&gt; has a class. class is a parameter because it's defined inside the tags.</p>
    <p class="two red an-element">An element can have mutliple classes separated by spaces</p>
    <p id="an-identifiant">Elements can also have only unique identifiant.</p>
    <p class="one red" id="only">An element can also have both classes and id</p>
    <p>An identifiant can be used only once</p>
    <p>A class can be used multiple times. Note that i am using one three times in this example.</p>
